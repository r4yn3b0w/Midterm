    <h1>Rayne's Guide to Minecraft 1.20</h1>
    <h2>Bamboo</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Minecraft doesn't often add new woods, but in 1.19 they added mangrove trees, and a new type of wood. Now, in 1.20, they're making bamboo act as a wood type!
      Previously, bamboo's only use was scaffolding. Now you can use it for doors, planks, stairs, rafts, etc.</p>
